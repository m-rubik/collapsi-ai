# Collapsi - AI

This project is a fan-made adaptation of the [*Collapsi*](https://riffleshuffleandroll.itch.io/collapsi) board game, developped by Mark from [*Riffle Shuffle & Roll*](https://www.youtube.com/@riffleshuffleandroll), with the aim of developing Q-Learning agents that can learn to play the game. This is not an official adaptation and is intended purely for educational and research purposes. Certain game mechanics and elements may have been modified or omitted in this version.

## About Collapsi
From the [Riffle Shuffle & Roll](https://riffleshuffleandroll.itch.io/collapsi) website:
> Collaspsi is an abstract strategy maze game for two (or more?) players.  As players move around the grid, the card they move from collapses, causing the grid to slowly close in on itself.  Use portals and cave-ins to your advantage. Trap your opponent and be the last player able to make a legal move to win the game.
*Burgle Bros.* is a cooperative heist game where players work together to break into a building, collect loot, and escape without getting caught. The game involves strategy, planning, and a bit of luck.

## Purpose of This Project

The goal of this project is to implement a modified version of *Collapsi* to create an environment for Q-Learning agents to learn how to play the game using reinforcement learning techniques. While inspired by the original game, this is not an official release.

# Collapsi - Modified Version

This project is a fan-made, modified version of the [*Collapsi*](https://riffleshuffleandroll.itch.io/collapsi) board game, developped by Mark from [*Riffle Shuffle & Roll*](https://www.youtube.com/@riffleshuffleandroll), with the aim of developing Q-Learning agents that can learn to play the game. This is not an official adaptation and is intended purely for educational and research purposes. Certain game mechanics and elements have been modified or omitted in this version.

## About Collapsi
From the [Riffle Shuffle & Roll](https://riffleshuffleandroll.itch.io/collapsi) page
> Collaspsi is an abstract strategy maze game for two (or more?) players.  As players move around the grid, the card they move from collapses, causing the grid to slowly close in on itself.  Use portals and cave-ins to your advantage. Trap your opponent and be the last player able to make a legal move to win the game.
*Burgle Bros.* is a cooperative heist game where players work together to break into a building, collect loot, and escape without getting caught. The game involves strategy, planning, and a bit of luck.

## Purpose of This Project

The goal of this project is to implement a modified version of *Collapsi* to create an environment for Q-Learning agents to learn how to play the game using reinforcement learning techniques. While inspired by the original game, this version contains modifications to the mechanics, and some elements of the original game may be altered or omitted. This is not an official release, and no copyrighted game assets (such as artwork or game components) from *Burgle Bros.* are included in this project.
